# Karst-forest-mites
1. This repository contains the primary datasets for the study. All statistical analyses were performed using these raw data files:

(1) mite.csv: mite metacommunity data.
(2) m_fungi.csv: Fungal feeders/ Secondary decomposers community data.
(3) m_predator.csv: Predator community data.
(4) m_decomp.csv: Primary decomposer community data.
(5) environment.csv: Soil environmental variables and sampling site geographical coordinates.


2. The Trophic group.xlsx file documents the methodology and results for assigning mites to trophic groups. It contains:

(1) The application of stable isotope data to classify mite species into their respective trophic functional groups.
(2) The resulting community parameters (including alpha diversity, beta diversity, 和 network complexity) for each trophic group, calculated using the averaging method.


3. Network Data & Visualizations

The following folders contain the resources for ecological network analysis in Gephi:

(1) mite meta-community networks: Data and graphs for the meta-community level network.
(2) Local community networks from different forest types: Data and graphs for networks specific to each forest type.

Each folder includes:

(1) Node and edge tables for Gephi.
(2) Original visualizations of the networks.


4. Code for Peer Review and Reproducibility
   
In accordance with journal policy on code submission for peer review, we have provided the complete R code necessary to replicate our study's findings as supplementary material.
This code is currently under embargo but will be archived and publicly accessible upon article acceptance.
Reviewers can obtain the code and linked datasets for verification by contacting the editorial team. 
The corresponding metadata necessary to run the scripts can be found in this repository.
